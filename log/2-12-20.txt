Goals of current session:

1. De-red MapDefFact, EqFact, SetDefFact, TermDefFact

2. Implement methods in the sockets

3. Change methods in EquationEditorController to mirror this
parallel model/view strategy being taken.  So take away notion
of currSequence and currElement from EquEditorController, and
add the new method receiveCharacter or addCharacter, or something like
that.

Log: Ok so I finished 1, and I'm working on 2.  3 is a big deal because
I'm moving from a strict MVC framework to a software where the model and
view are deeply intertwined, which helps in persistence (I think).
Next time, keep working on 2, and add plugs as they become apparent.
