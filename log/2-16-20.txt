10:33: First things first, I'm prioritizing sleep nowadays, so I'm going to go to bed soon. Let's outline
what has to happen here.

1. I just created the universal set.  This will be the default elementOf of all term sockets.
2. I need to add elementOf to the termSocket, and add the default behavior and getters and setters.
3. Continue my grand crusade of filling in the factories, but this time with proper behavior.


Just realized that if termSocket knows what kind of element to expect, then we don't
need the factories to have sequenceStateInContext.  Or do we.  Let me think.  Ok we don't
need sequenceStateInContext, but I need to be able to have some notion of a generic set of
all maps from an arbitrary domain to a particular set.  That's a definable object I think.
Then the parent factory can set the term socket's elementOf when a call to commitNotification
is made.  I'm go to bed.
