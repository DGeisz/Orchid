Ok so I'm almost falling asleep as we speak, but the move right now
is to implement bare bones of the Factories to de-red line EditorComplex
After Editor complex is no longer red, start filling in the factories with
actual implementation.  After that's finished, move onto the individual
sockets, then to the sets.  Actually plugs might come first.  Also some things to
note: 1. I'm making the string of socket ids start and end with a line,
so the first socket of the line's prevId is "" and the last socket of the lines
nextId is "".  Also I made plugs way more generic, so they're no longer just math
terms, anything that plugs into a socket.  It might have been a mistake to make
lines sockets, but now all the definition factories will output a special
type of plug that corresponds to the new definition.  Whatever. It'll work out.
