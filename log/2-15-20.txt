Ok so the newest thing that's bouncing around the ol nogerino is the fact
that there probably should be set sockets.  Anything non-syntactical on
the editor page should be a term, including sets. So everything should be
an OrchidTerm.  Like everything.  Then you can start to get the rich juice of
category theory in the software.  So, before moving forward, first things first.

1.  Get rid of SetSockets.  There shalt only be TermSockets.
2.  Get rid of MathSetPlug.  There shalt only be TermPlugs.
3.  Probably a couple factories will be yelling at you.  Fix those factories.

Ok, got that done.  Now, I'm back onto de-redding the sockets.  So now, I'm
doing the steps in log 2-13-20.

With the whole "sets are terms" philosophy, I'm starting to see issues with
cartesian products and ordered pairs.  Because of that, I'm going to push the implementation
of such structures until after PHASE I.  When you finish PHASE I, figure out if
you should do cartesians first or the Deletion Phase first.

2:51: Time to implement new methods in the factories.

3:10: Realized I have no way to actually represent rules yet.  Great.  Hadn't thought about
that for some reason.  Honestly, I think it should be fairly easy to implement.  I just have
to include relationships between OrchidTerms, and OrchidMaps.  I also have to come up with a way
to quickly access said relationships.  In a later EPOCH perhaps, I need to implement trie structures.
Those are clearly the only way.

3:50: I'm fading.  I think I'm gone bop on home in a bit.  Some quick things.  Term socket needs to have
some notion of the type of set its plugs are going to be elements of.  The map factory needs some
way to determine whether it's output is consistent with the TermSocket's expected set type. In terms of what
I've done, I finished throwing stuff into Equality factory and MapDefinitionFactory.

Wait, that's not true.  I need to implement sequenceStateInContext for MapDefinition Factory.  Actually that should
be easy.  I just have to make sure both terms are sets.  One moment.

Ok finished that up.  That was a piece of frikin cake.  Funny how the factories seem like they're always red.
