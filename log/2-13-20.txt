Ok so I think I was a bit premature in adding the isMapBuilder method
to EditorComplex. I think maps will be constructed using a built in
"snippet" with keyword "map."

Before moving on to 2 or 3 from previous log, I'm going to go back
in and implement that class.

12:00 PM:  I added MapFactory.  I have begun filling in sockets. TermSocket and SetSocket
are both going to have to call to their parent factories in isAllowedSequence() and commitSequence()
so I'll need to implement some more methods in the OrchidFactory class that allow sockets
to check whether a sequence is allowed or can be committed.  Also I think I'll add some
logic that allows you to commit a term into a termSocket that automatically becomes a mapFactory.
I think that would be pretty neat.
