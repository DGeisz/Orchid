Ok so I think I was a bit premature in adding the isMapBuilder method
to EditorComplex. I think maps will be constructed using a built in
"snippet" with keyword "map."

Before moving on to 2 or 3 from previous log, I'm going to go back
in and implement that class.

12:00 PM:  I added MapFactory.  I have begun filling in sockets. TermSocket and SetSocket
are both going to have to call to their parent factories in isAllowedSequence() and commitSequence()
so I'll need to implement some more methods in the OrchidFactory class that allow sockets
to check whether a sequence is allowed or can be committed.  Also I think I'll add some
logic that allows you to commit a term into a termSocket that automatically becomes a mapFactory.
I think that would be pretty neat.

3:31 PM:  Ok one thing, when setPlug is called, the plug is given a reference
to the socket.  Make sure you use that reference to set the parentId of the plug
to the socket in question.  Also make sure that when a call is made to getFactoryOutput,
the parent of the factory is set to the plug.  Otherwise, everything is going to
the dogs.

3:45 PM: Ok I think I'm in a pretty good place.  I think I'm going to briefly go back
to 3 from the last log before I proceed to de-red the sockets.  That's going to be a bit of a lengthy process.

4:08 PM: Good sauce my dude.  Finished 3 from the previous log, and it was kinda a piece of cake.
Next to do list:

1. De-red the sockets.
2. Implement new methods in Factories.
3. Implement methods in Plugs.

At this point, you'll probably need to define term classes.  After 3 would be a pretty
great time to do so.
