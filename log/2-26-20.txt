I built a new testing framework, and it's the literal sauce.
Takes in an input text file, and types it directly into orchid.
It's pretty great.  This somewhat solves the problem of persistence,
so I'm going to move onto something else on the 2-22-20 list.

I think I'm first going to do deletion because Rules will require more unique
architecture, and it would be nice to have deletion in place because it's going to
be a very similar thing to commitSequence.  I think it's going do a call to its parent
factory telling it that a deletion has taken place.  The parent factory will either
redirect the cursor to one of its other sockets, or delete itself, and redirect all
the way back to it's parent socket.  Yeah I'll do this first.  Rules next.

And my gosh, at some point I gotta do cartesian fucking sets.  That has to be done.
